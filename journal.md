#Title
Secondary organic aerosol measurments over west Africa.

#Introduction
We present measurements of SOA from aircraft over west Africa.
J. BLoggs et al already took some measurements there, but they haven't answered all the scientific questions.
Of course, J. Smith et al made some great measurments in the 1980s in this region.
