Aircraft measurements of Secondary organic aerosol measurments over west Africa.

Model-measurments of Secondary organic aerosol measurments over west Africa.


#Introduction
We present measurements of SOA from aircraft over west Africa.
J. BLoggs et al already took some measurements there, but they haven't answered all the scientific questions.
Of course, J. Smith et al made some great measurments in the 1980s in this region.

#simulations
Jogn has a great model which simulates particle formation from forest fire emissions
